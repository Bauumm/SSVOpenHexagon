            "calculations.",

            "Below are the message functions, which can be identified with the "
            "\"m_\" prefix. These functions are capable "
            "of displaying custom messages on the screen which can help pack "
            "developers communicate additional info or "
            "anything else useful (e.g Song Lyrics) to the players. For "
            "keeping track of statistics, please look at "

            "with the \"t_\" prefix. These are functions "
            "that have effects on the main timeline itself, but they mainly "
            "consist of waiting functions. Using these "

            "are for the event timeline as opposed to "

            "is on the level. Style attributes, unlike "
            "level attributes, do not get initialized in Lua and rather are "

            "variety of walls that can be made with different "

            "programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
